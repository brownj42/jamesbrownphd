The structural and electronic properties of the carbonyl sulfide dimer anion are calculated using density functional theory within a pseudopotential method. Three geometries are optimized and investigated: C2v and C2 symmetric, as well as one asymmetric structure. A distribution of an excess charge in three isomers are studied by the Hirshfeld method. In an asymmetric isomer the charge is not equally divided between the two moieties, but it is distributed as OCS-0.6���OCS-0.4. Low-lying excitation levels of three isomers are compared using the time-dependent density functional theory in the Casida approach."

Four bands are analysed: two fundamentals of the mixed 14N2O-15N2O dimer and combination bands involving the intermolecular disrotation of the monomers (Bu intermolecular bend) for both (14N2O)2 and (15N2O)2. Because the determination of this intermolecular frequency relies on the experimentally unknown frequency of the (forbidden) symmetric fundamental{,} we used previously published ab initio results and their proximity to our experimental values to assign the upper state of the combination bands. The resulting intermolecular disrotation frequencies are 42.3(1.0) and 41.6(1.0) cm-1 for the (14N2O)2 and (15N2O)2{,} respectively. This represents the first observation of the mixed 14N2O-15N2O dimer{,} and the direct determination of a second intermolecular frequency for the nonpolar (N2O)2."}

CO2 lasers were used to excite the first overtone of the OCS Î½2 bending vibration at frequencies âˆ¼1045 cm-1. Measurements included (a) the laser fluence dependence of the photodissocn. yield at fixed frequency, (b) the laser frequency dependence of the dissocn. yield at const. fluence, and (c) the speed and angle distributions of OCS products from the dissocn. of (OCS)2. Single homogeneous absorption peaks were obsd. for Ar.OCS and (OCS)2, with line widths of 1.0 and 3.7 cm-1, resp., corresponding to uncertainty principle lifetimes of 5 and 1.5 ps. The (OCS)3 spectrum contained 2 peaks, with widths âˆ¼6 cm-1 (0.8 ps). The absorption intensities per OCS mol. in the clusters were much smaller than that of isolated OCS, reflecting interactions which modify the Fermi resonance which is largely responsible for the 2Î½2 oscillator strength. The OCS product velocity vector distribution from (OCS)2 photodissocn. was isotropic, with âˆ¼1% of the available energy appearing in translation. Lifetimes corresponding to these spectral widths were not the vibrational predissocn. lifetimes but instead were the lifetimes for relaxation of the initial nonstationary coherent states by anharmonic coupling within the van der Waals complexes.

	abstract={Infrared spectra of a carbon disulfide trimer formed in a pulsed supersonic slit-jet expansion are obtained via direct absorption of a tuneable diode laser in the region of the CS2 ν 3 fundamental (∼1535 cm−1 ). This is the first high-resolution spectroscopic observation of (CS2 )3 . Two bands sharing the same lower state are assigned to (12 C32 S2 )3 . These correspond to the two infrared active trimer vibrations (a parallel and a perpendicular band) of the constituent CS2 monomer asymmetric stretches. The weaker perpendicular band is centered at 1524.613 cm−1 , shifted by −10.74 cm−1 with respect to the free CS2 monomer. The parallel band is centered at 1545.669 cm−1 , a vibrational shift of +10.31 cm−1 . Transitions with K ≠ 3n and those with K = 0, J = odd in the ground state are absent, establishing that this trimer has D 3 symmetry. The two parameters required to define this structure are determined to be 3.811 Å for the C−C bond distance and 61.8° for the angle between a monomer axis and the plane containing the C atoms. In addition, a parallel band arising from trimers with a single 34 S substitution is observed around 1544.46 cm−1 . Together with the recently observed cross-shaped CS2 dimer, these results indicate a tendency for CS2 to form highly symmetric clusters.},

abstract ={The year 1970 has been suggested as a starting date for the "third age of quantum chemistry," in which theory takes on not only qualitative but also quantitative value. In fact, each of the years 1960, 1970, 1972, and 1977 is of historical value in the unraveling of the structure and energetics of the CH2 molecule, methylene. What took place for methylene, namely the establishment of credibility for theory, has subsequently taken place for many other molecules. Three important roles for quantitative theory are outlined: (i) theory precedes experiment; (ii) theory overturns experiment, as resolved by later experiments; and (iii) theory and experiment work together to gain insight that is afforded independently to neither. Several examples from each of the three classes are given.},

Results from the least-squares fits for the 0400-0000, 0420(e)-0000, and 0510-0110 bands of the 14N216O molecule indicate that the high-J levels of the upper states are perturbed. Resonance interactions were observed in transitions in the 1001-1000 band of 14N216O and 15N14N16O and the 1111(f)-1110(f), 0600-0200, 0600-1000, and 0620(e)-1000 bands of 14N216O.},

The present analysis substantially improves the spectroscopic characterization of near infrared OCS in a window region (3850-4200 cm-1) important for atmospheric studies of Venus. Previous studies in this spectral region cataloged numerous OCS line positions, but accurate line intensities were measured for only three strong bands. In this paper, the corresponding line intensities are obtained for 41 OCS bands, including weak isotopic bands reported for the first time. The 2[nu]3 (0002-0000) band is analyzed for 10 OCS isotopologues (adding 16O13C34S, 17O12C32S, 16O12C36S, 18O12C34S, and 16O13C33S). In addition, observations of 0332-0330 of the main isotope, 16O12C32S, provides accurate vibration-rotation parameters for the upper state (and the lower state, 0330 of 16O12C32S). Finally, one unidentified band is seen at 3969.3 cm-1; its lower state is clearly the ground state of 16O12C32S. The line strengths of these seven previously unanalyzed bands plus 34 other bands of the OCS isotopologues, 16O12C32S, 16O12C34S, 16O13C32S, 16O12C33S, and 18O12C32S, were least-squares fitted to determine strength parameters, Sv and Herman-Wallis coefficients. Finally, the intensities of 17 additional very weak bands were estimated to provide an extensive new database of OCS line parameters to support remote sensing of Venus. The integrated intensity in cm-1/(molecule cm-2) at 296 K is 8.1×10-19 for the 3800-4200 cm-1 region."

Two transition structures corresponding to the interconversion of enantiomeric forms of the parallel and the most stable of the antiparallel arrangements were located on the potential energy surface.

Abstract = {We present a method for computing bend energy levels of a five-atom molecule. We use polyspherical coordinates in terms of which both the kinetic energy operator and its associated volume element are simple. The basis functions we use are new. They are parity-adapted combinations of products of spherical harmonics and an associated Legendre function. We show that in the parity-adpated basis it is possible to evaluate matrix-vector products efficiently, despite the fact that the parity-adapted functions are not products of functions of a single variable. The method is applied to compute bend levels of methane. Within each parity block we use the symmetry-adapted Lanczos algorithm to compute levels labeled by irreps of a four-member group that contains the parity operator and the permutation of two of the four hydrogen atoms. In a future publication we shall use the bend wave functions as contracted basis functions to compute numerically exact vibrational levels of methane. [ABSTRACT FR},

Abstract = {Theoretical studies of the potential energy surface and bound states were performed for the N2O dimer. A four-dimensional intermolecular potential energy surface (PES) was constructed at the CCSD(T) level with aug-cc-pVTZ basis set supplemented with bond functions. Three co-planar local minima were found on this surface. They correspond to a nonpolar isomer with slipped-antiparallel planar structure and two equivalent polar isomers with slipped-parallel planar structures. The nonpolar isomer is energetically more stable than the polar ones by 162 cm-1. To assign the fundamental vibrational frequencies for both isomers, more than 150 vibrational bound states were calculated based on this PES. The orientation of the nodal surface of the wave functions plays an important role in the assignment of disrotation and conrotation vibrational modes. The calculated vibrational frequencies are in good agreement with the available experimental data. We have also found a quantum tunneling effect be},
