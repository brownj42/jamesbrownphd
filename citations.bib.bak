The structural and electronic properties of the carbonyl sulfide dimer anion are calculated using density functional theory within a pseudopotential method. Three geometries are optimized and investigated: C2v and C2 symmetric, as well as one asymmetric structure. A distribution of an excess charge in three isomers are studied by the Hirshfeld method. In an asymmetric isomer the charge is not equally divided between the two moieties, but it is distributed as OCS-0.6���OCS-0.4. Low-lying excitation levels of three isomers are compared using the time-dependent density functional theory in the Casida approach."

An observed band with c-type rotational structure is assigned as a combination of the intramolecular N2O [small nu]1 stretching vibration and the intermolecular out-of-plane dimer torsional vibration{,} with a vibrational origin at 2249.360 cm-1. The resulting torsional frequency for the nonpolar N2O dimer is about 21.5 cm-1. The present rotational analysis is completely different from that reported previously for the same band [Hecker et al.{,} Phys. Chem. Chem.

abstract  ="Spectra of the nonpolar nitrous oxide dimer in the region of the N2O [small nu]1 fundamental band are observed in a pulsed supersonic slit jet expansion probed with a tunable diode laser. Four bands are analysed: two fundamentals of the mixed 14N2O-15N2O dimer and combination bands involving the intermolecular disrotation of the monomers (Bu intermolecular bend) for both (14N2O)2 and (15N2O)2. Because the determination of this intermolecular frequency relies on the experimentally unknown frequency of the (forbidden) symmetric fundamental{,} we used previously published ab initio results and their proximity to our experimental values to assign the upper state of the combination bands. The resulting intermolecular disrotation frequencies are 42.3(1.0) and 41.6(1.0) cm-1 for the (14N2O)2 and (15N2O)2{,} respectively. This represents the first observation of the mixed 14N2O-15N2O dimer{,} and the direct determination of a second intermolecular frequency for the nonpolar (N2O)2."}

Ionization efficiency curves of homogeneous cluster ions (OCS)n+, homogeneous sulfur cluster ions Sm+ and inhomogeneous ions (OCS)nSm+ are analyzed. Several reactions paths, ending in Sm+, have been identified. The strong correlation between reaction path and cluster size is discussed. Finally, by minimization of the potential function created by dipole-dipole, dipole-quadrupole, and quadrupole-quadrupole interactions between OCS mols., we propose the geometrical configurations of neutral (OCS)n (n=2-5) clusters.

CO2 lasers were used to excite the first overtone of the OCS Î½2 bending vibration at frequencies âˆ¼1045 cm-1. Measurements included (a) the laser fluence dependence of the photodissocn. yield at fixed frequency, (b) the laser frequency dependence of the dissocn. yield at const. fluence, and (c) the speed and angle distributions of OCS products from the dissocn. of (OCS)2. Single homogeneous absorption peaks were obsd. for Ar.OCS and (OCS)2, with line widths of 1.0 and 3.7 cm-1, resp., corresponding to uncertainty principle lifetimes of 5 and 1.5 ps. The (OCS)3 spectrum contained 2 peaks, with widths âˆ¼6 cm-1 (0.8 ps). The absorption intensities per OCS mol. in the clusters were much smaller than that of isolated OCS, reflecting interactions which modify the Fermi resonance which is largely responsible for the 2Î½2 oscillator strength. The OCS product velocity vector distribution from (OCS)2 photodissocn. was isotropic, with âˆ¼1% of the available energy appearing in translation. Lifetimes corresponding to these spectral widths were not the vibrational predissocn. lifetimes but instead were the lifetimes for relaxation of the initial nonstationary coherent states by anharmonic coupling within the van der Waals complexes.

abstract  ="The internal rotation ([small nu]9) of nitric acid is studied using several ab initio models including 1D models and full dimensionality (9D) ones. For the 9D calculations{,} an adiabatic separation between the large amplitude motion{,} i.e. the torsion{,} and the eight other modes is performed. The potential energy surface is calculated at CCSD(T) level with a triple zeta atomic basis set and is expanded in a Taylor series up to the second-order along the torsional path. The vibrational calculations are performed with the codes ElVibRot and Tnum. Our main results show that the torsional energy levels and the corresponding tunneling spliting are in good agreement with the experimental ones. Furthermore{,} the resonance between 2[small nu]9 and [small nu]5 (NO2 in-plane bending) is also well described with full dimensionality models."

	abstract={Infrared spectra of a carbon disulfide trimer formed in a pulsed supersonic slit-jet expansion are obtained via direct absorption of a tuneable diode laser in the region of the CS2 ν 3 fundamental (∼1535 cm−1 ). This is the first high-resolution spectroscopic observation of (CS2 )3 . Two bands sharing the same lower state are assigned to (12 C32 S2 )3 . These correspond to the two infrared active trimer vibrations (a parallel and a perpendicular band) of the constituent CS2 monomer asymmetric stretches. The weaker perpendicular band is centered at 1524.613 cm−1 , shifted by −10.74 cm−1 with respect to the free CS2 monomer. The parallel band is centered at 1545.669 cm−1 , a vibrational shift of +10.31 cm−1 . Transitions with K ≠ 3n and those with K = 0, J = odd in the ground state are absent, establishing that this trimer has D 3 symmetry. The two parameters required to define this structure are determined to be 3.811 Å for the C−C bond distance and 61.8° for the angle between a monomer axis and the plane containing the C atoms. In addition, a parallel band arising from trimers with a single 34 S substitution is observed around 1544.46 cm−1 . Together with the recently observed cross-shaped CS2 dimer, these results indicate a tendency for CS2 to form highly symmetric clusters.},

abstract ={The year 1970 has been suggested as a starting date for the "third age of quantum chemistry," in which theory takes on not only qualitative but also quantitative value. In fact, each of the years 1960, 1970, 1972, and 1977 is of historical value in the unraveling of the structure and energetics of the CH2 molecule, methylene. What took place for methylene, namely the establishment of credibility for theory, has subsequently taken place for many other molecules. Three important roles for quantitative theory are outlined: (i) theory precedes experiment; (ii) theory overturns experiment, as resolved by later experiments; and (iii) theory and experiment work together to gain insight that is afforded independently to neither. Several examples from each of the three classes are given.},

The present analysis substantially improves the spectroscopic characterization of near infrared OCS in a window region (3850-4200 cm-1) important for atmospheric studies of Venus. Previous studies in this spectral region cataloged numerous OCS line positions, but accurate line intensities were measured for only three strong bands. In this paper, the corresponding line intensities are obtained for 41 OCS bands, including weak isotopic bands reported for the first time. The 2[nu]3 (0002-0000) band is analyzed for 10 OCS isotopologues (adding 16O13C34S, 17O12C32S, 16O12C36S, 18O12C34S, and 16O13C33S). In addition, observations of 0332-0330 of the main isotope, 16O12C32S, provides accurate vibration-rotation parameters for the upper state (and the lower state, 0330 of 16O12C32S). Finally, one unidentified band is seen at 3969.3 cm-1; its lower state is clearly the ground state of 16O12C32S. The line strengths of these seven previously unanalyzed bands plus 34 other bands of the OCS isotopologues, 16O12C32S, 16O12C34S, 16O13C32S, 16O12C33S, and 18O12C32S, were least-squares fitted to determine strength parameters, Sv and Herman-Wallis coefficients. Finally, the intensities of 17 additional very weak bands were estimated to provide an extensive new database of OCS line parameters to support remote sensing of Venus. The integrated intensity in cm-1/(molecule cm-2) at 296 K is 8.1×10-19 for the 3800-4200 cm-1 region."

Six min. energy structures were located and characterized. The most stable one corresponds to an antiparallel arrangement of the monomers, in agreement with microwave spectroscopic expts. The nature of the interactions present in the trimer was analyzed by using the Symmetry Adapted Perturbation Theory. The importance of the induction forces in this type of system suggests that results from semiempirical potentials with no inclusion of this component should be considered with extreme caution. The anal. helps to rationalize the exptl. obsd. preference for the antiparallel arrangement. Two transition structures corresponding to the interconversion of enantiomeric forms of the parallel and the most stable of the antiparallel arrangements were located on the potential energy surface. The relatively high energy barrier between them is consistent with the very small splittings exhibited by the rotational lines of the microwave spectra. [on SciFinder(R)]},

@article{Zheng2011,
Abstract = {Theoretical studies of the potential energy surface and bound states were performed for the N2O dimer. A four-dimensional intermolecular potential energy surface (PES) was constructed at the CCSD(T) level with aug-cc-pVTZ basis set supplemented with bond functions. Three co-planar local minima were found on this surface. They correspond to a nonpolar isomer with slipped-antiparallel planar structure and two equivalent polar isomers with slipped-parallel planar structures. The nonpolar isomer is energetically more stable than the polar ones by 162 cm-1. To assign the fundamental vibrational frequencies for both isomers, more than 150 vibrational bound states were calculated based on this PES. The orientation of the nodal surface of the wave functions plays an important role in the assignment of disrotation and conrotation vibrational modes. The calculated vibrational frequencies are in good agreement with the available experimental data. We have also found a quantum tunneling effect be},
